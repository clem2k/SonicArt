## List of Materials 

### Main components

You can obviously change any of the part with some less expensive or more available, please note the dimensions of the mold : the base of the mould is 18cm x 18cm, and all the graphics I've put together are also 18x18. If you change the mold and have different sizes, do not forget to update the graphics files. If you choose something smaller than 18x18, be advised that cutting will be very tricky as the small parts (such as rings and lives indicator) are really small.

### You'll also need : 

- a printer
- a soldering iron (and solder, third hand, ...)
- something to cut the prints (i used a Brother "Scan'n Cut" and scissors)
- Some paper glue
- Epoxy Resin (I used about 800 grams), protections gloves, some mask, and usual stuff when dealing with epoxy resin (try and ask google for epoxy resin works and safety tips : DO NOT USE EPOXY RESIN if you don't know how to be safe with that kind of products, it's hazardous material : SAFETY FIRST !)

## Print work

All the files are designed to be 18cm by 18cm, the same as the base of my silicon mold, if you'd like to use another mold do not forget to change the size of each art file. In order to have a kind of 3D effect we need to have different layers.

The real background image is Ciel2.jpg, it must be your first layer

Then comes the mountains in the background Decor1.jpg

![](https://github.com/clem2k/SonicArt/blob/8a44ed843cbbd3b109aedd5d82b67ce09dd609e7/Layers/arts/Decor1.jpg)

Then you'll need Decor2.jpg

![](https://github.com/clem2k/SonicArt/blob/8a44ed843cbbd3b109aedd5d82b67ce09dd609e7/Layers/arts/Decor2.jpg)

Decor3.jpg is the most foreground layer

![](https://github.com/clem2k/SonicArt/blob/main/Layers/arts/Decor3.jpg)

For the remaining files (Access1.jpg, Access2.jpg, Rings.jpg, Sonic.jpg) you can just print and cut them, it's the final foreground layer.
